            A travel agency company is a business that specializes in providing travel-related services to individuals, families, and groups. These services typically include booking flights, hotels, rental cars, cruises, tours, and activities. Travel agency companies also provide travel advice and assistance to clients, helping them plan their travel itineraries, choose destinations, and make informed decisions about their travel plans. The primary goal of a travel agency company is to provide convenient and hassle-free travel experiences to its clients, ensuring that they have a memorable and enjoyable trip. With the rise of online travel booking platforms, travel agency companies have adapted their business models, focusing on personalized service, expert advice, and customized travel experiences to differentiate themselves from their competitors.
